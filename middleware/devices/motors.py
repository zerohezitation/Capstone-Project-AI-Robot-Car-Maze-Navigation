Motors
This class controls the motors, and more generally anything connected to the LABISTS
daughter board that uses the I2C bus, including the headlights and servo.

We are restricted in what we can do by the protocol of the I2C commands.
It is important that we don't send commands too fast, or else they will get eaten up by the I2C bus.
However, we want to send commands to the middleware really fast. The solution is to store the target
speed values in a buffer. We can send commands to update the target speeds instantaneously.
Another thread continuously sends the commands to the I2C bus only when the target speed changes,
or as fast as it is able to.

We're also limited by the physical capabilities of the motors. The motors are geared to have a high speed
but low torque. This means that at the lowest speed setting, it does not take much resistance for the motors
to stall and fail to spin. However, once you set the speed high enough to overcome the static friction, 
the gearing is too high, and the robot moves too fast to be able to reliably process the camera feed in time.
The solution is to implement some sort of PWM control in VIPLE. Turn the motors on at a some power for a short
period of time, and stop for some period of time. By varying duty cycle, you can control the speed in a more
fine-grained manner, at the cost of a more jerky motion. We're still limited by the speed at which we
can send commands down the I2C bus; if we send commands at too high of a frequency, the robot will skip
phases in the PWM cycle, which manifests as an uneven, jerking motion.
