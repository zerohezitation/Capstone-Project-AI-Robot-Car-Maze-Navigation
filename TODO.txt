First, create manual for Professor Chen on how to use the middleware(in README) and how the VIPLE programs are meant to be used with the middleware.
- pip install websockets
- pip install smbus2
- pip install asyncio
- sudo apt-get update
- get sean to download middleware on 3rd robot
Some changes that need to be made with the middleware:
- Setting up an agrument function for entering in the host and port (needs to be set to the Wi-Fi ip address on both VIPLE and middleware)
- Comment the existing middleware code to make more readable
- Fix the speed of the car by adding parameters to the forward and backward functions

Additional features:
- Add the object detection programs from Sean's car into the GitHub 
- Add the VIPLE programs in a new folder
