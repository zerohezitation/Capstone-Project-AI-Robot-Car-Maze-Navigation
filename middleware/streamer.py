Streamer
A video streaming server. 
This is run on the raspberry pi robot, and it will listen for remote connections.
Once connected, the server will encode the camera frames and send them to the client
to decode and display. See streamer_client.py for the client application.

This gets run in the background when you start the middleware, but you can also run this
file independently to run the streamer standalone without the middleware:

python3 -m middleware.streamer
